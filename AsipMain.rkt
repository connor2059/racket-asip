;; The basic idea is similar to racket-firmata: we set up input and output 
;; streams attached to a serial port. The main thread (this one) deals with
;; writing, a separate thread handles the input. The input thread writes 
;; values to arrays of bit values, see below.

;; How to use it: you can use any of the functions and constants exported
;; below in the (provide... ) block. This is a minimal example:


;; TODO [FR]: Here we may want to export something, commented for the moment.

;; Processing port mapping is the most complicated part of ASIP. The initial message tells how to
;; map port bits to pins. Example message FROM Arduino:
;; - @I,M,20,{4:1,4:2,4:4,4:8,4:10,4:20,4:40,4:80,2:1,2:2,2:4,2:8,2:10,2:20,3:1,3:2,3:4,3:8,3:10,3:20}
;; (this is the mapping of pins: pin 0 is mapped to the first bit of port
;; 4, pin 1 to the second bit of port 4, etc. MAPPING IS IN HEX! so 20 is
;; 32. Take the conjunction of this with the port and you get the pin
;; value)
;; Here we set up this initial mapping. We use the hash map PORT-MAPPING-TABLE. This table
;; maps a port number to another hash map. In this second hash map we map positions in the port 
;; (expressed as powers of 2, so 1 means position 0, 16 means position 5, etc.)
;; Overall, this looks something like (see message above)
;; PORT=4 ---> (POSITION=1 ---> PIN=0)
;;             (POSITION=2 ---> PIN=1)
;;             ...
;; PORT=2 ---> (POSITION=1 ---> PIN=8)
;;             ...
